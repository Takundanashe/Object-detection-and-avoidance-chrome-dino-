# Object-detection-and-avoidance-chrome-dino-
This project uses YOLOv11s, a fast and efficient object detection model from Ultralytics, to detect key game objects including the dinosaur, cacti, and birds in real time. YOLOv11s --> high detection speed and low computational requirements, making it ideal for real-time applications.  For decision-making and obstacle avoidance, -- NEAT algorithm.

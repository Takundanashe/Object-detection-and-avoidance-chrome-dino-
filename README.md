# Object-detection-and-avoidance-chrome-dino-
This project uses YOLOv11s, a fast and efficient object detection model from Ultralytics, to detect key game objects including the dinosaur, cacti, and birds in real time. YOLOv11s was selected for its high detection speed and low computational requirements, making it ideal for real-time applications.For decision-making and obstacle avoidance, the project employs the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. NEAT evolves neural networks over successive generations, enabling the agent to learn optimal avoidance strategies without predefined rules. By combining real-time object detection with neuroevolution, the system learns to autonomously navigate the game environment and avoid obstacles effectively.
